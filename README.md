# HJC Code Editor
HCJ Code Editor WordPress Plugin is a plugin which  allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in realtime and preview the results on the same page. Itâ€™s almost same as JSFiddle or Codepen , but more simple. I made it for my collection HTML , CSS , JS Code and practicing my programming. Also i want to organize my simple code based on category and modify the theme. Just use in localhost only.
I suggest if you want to use it , just using in your localhost only and not in production hosting. Because it allow execute javascript
